# Node Classification and Link Prediction with GNNs
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is a powerful approach to analyzing complex relationships in data. This collection of notebooks demonstrates how PyTorch Geometric (PyG) can be leveraged for real-world tasks, such as anti-money laundering and recommendation systems. The code from Chapter 14 can be directly tested on Google `colab` using the following links:

* [Node Classification in Bitcoin Using PyG for Anti-Money Laundering](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qfXnnojBuQO_EEDPQS_gEkmhwwCll7Wo?usp=sharing)

This notebook explores node classification in the Bitcoin transaction network. The goal is to detect illicit transactions associated with money laundering using GNNs. By leveraging PyG, we classify nodes as either licit or illicit based on their transactional behavior.

* [Link Prediction in MovieLens Using PyG for Recommendation Systems](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1uWqwZUlG66hxYl3w_-vntDuW4CubrVsU?usp=sharing)

This notebook explores link prediction in the MovieLens dataset to improve recommendation systems. Using PyG, we predict potential user-movie interactions, helping to build personalized movie recommendations.
