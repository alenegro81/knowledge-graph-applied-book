These\nopportunities are enhanced by the fact that a 3000 ft. range of elevation is available in the immediate neighborhood of the station, with the station located near\nthe upper portion of this range. The Highlands Museum has already obtained funds\nwhich have enabled it to buy land and a small, non-natural, lake.

The RF contribution of $10,000 per year, available when matched, must\nbe completely expended during the year in question to avoid lapsing. Just\nwhat charges can be made against this $10,000? In particular, suppose\nthat\nthe committee in charge at Harvard definitely decides to purchase certain apparatus, or to spend a certain sum for installation of apparatus. Can such\nsums be charged before the money in question is actually expended? The committee plans to install masonry piers in the new Harvard Observatory to be\nused, later, for seismographic work. Must such construction be completed\nand paid for within a given year in order that the expense thereof be chargeable against the current year's grant?\n2.

During the last year or two, there has been spent a\nyearly sum of approxinately $1500 for development purposes, most of this\nhaving been spent through and by the Union of American Biological Societies.\nThis latter sum was obtained partially from the A.A.A.S., partially in\nthe form of a special grant from the N.R.C., and partially in the form of\ndonations from constituent biological societies.

Eisenhart (Princeton) and Prof.R.G.D.Richardson (Brown), Pres. & Secy. respectively, of American Mathematical Society:\nWhile at a meeting of the A.M.S. at Columbia, talked with Pres. E. and\nSecy R. of the A.M.S. concerning the financial problem of mathematical publication.\nN.R.C. findings relative to scientific publications have revealed one class of difficulties which are judged temporary, and a second which are judged permanent.\nRF\ndoes not wish to be concerned with second sort through grants to N.R.C., at least\nof present type. Mathematics has been judged to be in second class. Present\ngrant made solely because warning from N.R.C was brief, and because neither A.M.S.\nnor RF is presumably prepared to make, at this time, permanent disposal of this supposedly permanent problem. RF will not expect to receive from A.M.S. further requests for extensions of present grants; but this does not preclude possibility of\ndiscussing with RF new proposals looking toward real and permanent solution of the\ndifficulties.\nDiscussed somewhat the possibility of A.M.S. attempting experiment in allocating publication costs to original research budget (Physics Society scheme) .\nThis has been tentatively discussed by trustees of A.M.S.; and at the moment they\nlean toward a somewhat different scheme. They judge, firstly, that the Physical\nSociety scheme will work much better for any laboratory science than for mathematics. Laboratory sciences normally have departmental sums available for supplies,\napparatus, services, and research, even if only the small sums which can be robbed\nfrom the student laboratory fees. Mathematics departments do not normally have any\nsuch funds. It would probably, therefore, be much slower and more difficult to get\nthe Physical Review scheme going for Mathematics, and perhaps the scheme would never\nsucceed nearly as well. Secondly, they think the Physical Review scheme administratively clumsy, particularly if it be extended to several fields. In forming\na\nbudget for a given year, one would never know how much to set up for this purpose.\nBrown, for example, set up $100, and long and unexpected publications by chemists\nin The Physical Review almost exhausted the fund before any physicists were ready\nto apply. If, moreover, a department sets up a definite sum for this purpose,\nthere is danger that the department heads will themselves exercise an individual,\nand perhaps not always wise or unselfish, editorial authority by discouraging certain publication and encouraging other. Thirdly, granting the fundamental point\nthat publication cost should be part of a normal research budget, it does not necessarily follow that individual departments should, each year, always pay precisely\non the basis of page production. To exaggerate the point, it would clearly be\nridiculous for universities to adjust the yearly salaries of staff on the basis of\nstatistical evidence as to hours of teaching, conference help, committee meetings\nattended, and pages of research printed. Fourthly, some feel that the Physical\nReview scheme will have a very unfortunate effect on the freedom of opportunity to\npublish (see memo. of interview with Hedrick Feb.26/32.)\nTrustees of A.M.S. at present feel that these difficulties could be avoided\nby a scheme which provides for institutions underwriting a regular pledged amount per\nyear towards mathematical publication costs as an integral part of mathematical budgets. It is hoped that there are five or six institutions which would pledge $500\na year or more; and a dozen or fifteen which would give #200 or $250. There may\nwell be twenty others which could give $50. The A.M.S. proposes to study this problem, and hopes to come to RF with some scheme which will involve, perhaps, the matching of pledges for a preliminary period.\n(Copy sent EB)\n"}, {"id": "Warren Weaver_Diary_1932-1933_31", "page_idx": 31, "text": "Monday, March 29, 1932\nDr. E.

The remaining income consists of\nmembership fees, and voluntary contributions from the Board of Trustees and interested friends.\nThe Garden was organized for educational and research purposes, and research\nhas played an important role from the beginning. Several years a.go it was desired\nto add a research curator to study the development of disease-resisting strains of\nplants. A friend of the Garden furnished $10,000 a year for 5 years for this purpose, expressing the hope that, at the conclusion of this period, the work would\nhave\nmade a sufficient record to justify approaching some foundation for permanent\nsupport. Following the death of this friend, his two sisters have been\ncontributing about $7,000 a year to continue this work, but they have recently announced that\nit will not be possible for them to continue this support beyond January 1933.\nThe\nsum contributed for this research goes largely for the salary of the research curator\n($5,500), the remainder covering one assistant, a part-time stenographer,\nand\nsome\nexpense for travel and supplies.

( One year ago it was $78,000, and the present year the\nbudget will be cut to a figure between $50,000 and $60,000. The grounds, building\nand equipment represent an investment of approximately $350,000, and there is $50,000\nendowment. For some years past, the station has shown a deficit each year. In\ngood times this was viewed as permissible and as having a stimulating effect on subscriptions for the following year. The trustees, however, permitted this practice\nto extend beyond the period of good times, and a $20,000 deficit was thus accumulated\nwhich could be met only by borrowing, using endowment securities as collateral.\n$7,000 was recently paid on this loan. Except for the small income from the endowment, the annual budget is met by annual subscriptions and gifts. The budget figures\ngiven above are net, after taking into account the income from summer fees, commissary,\netc.\nThe Director judges the most significant and essential part of their program\nto be their summer work, when approximately 40 graduate students and 60 postdoctorate\nresearch workers gather at the station. The second most essential feature of their\nprogram he judges to be the work in biophysics under the direction of Dr. Hugo Fricke.\nDr. Fricke is primarily a physicist, who had his training at Copenhagen and Lund, and\nlater, under fellowship of 'the American-Scandimavian Foundation, worked at Harvard\nand\nColumbia in 1919-20. Fricke has had 4 technicians under him, a glass-blower, an instrument maker, a chemist and a radio man. He wishes to add 2 postdoctorate assistants, and cut his staff of technicians if necessary. He is carrying on 3 principal\nprojects: (1) researches on the conductivity, capacity, and polarization of biological systems; (2) researches on the chemical effect of X-rays, including the development of a chemical device for measuring X-ray dosage; (3) the catalytic effect of\nexceedingly small percentages of organic substances on reaction rates.\nH. judges that the minimum starvation budget for the station is $46,000 yearly.\nOn the present basis, which is between $50,000 and $60,000, 84% of his budget\nis devoted .to salaries and wages. At the present time he has only $29,000 definitely in hand to meet the present year's expenditure, $20,000 of which is the RF contribution made last year. It is not, however, true that he has obtained only $9,000\nthis year from other sources, since he has paid up nearly $20,000 deficit on last\nyear and the $7,000, mentioned above, on the loan.\nWW asked H. what was, in his view, the fundamental scientific justification\nfor the existence of the Cold Spring Harbor station, in view of other existing facilities.\nH. expressed great admiration for Woods Hole, but pointed out that some workers would always prefer to go to a smaller place. H. believed, secondly, that the\nall-year-round program of the Cold Spring Harbor station is a very important feature.\nIt avoids certain inefficiencies of a purely seasonal organization, the summer workers\ncome to a going concern where work is in steady progress, and the workers from smaller\ninstitutions are thrown into relatively intimate contact with Fricke's permanent work\nin biophysics, this contact serving to disseminate widely the influence of this research.

He judges that the summer has been a very\nsuccessful one. The normal number of students were in attendance and there\nwas a very slight falling off (two or three men) of visiting professors. The\nlatter decrease occurred largely because the station did not dare, on account\nof their precarious financial condition, actively to encourage the presence\nof visitors.\nBetween $24,000 and $25,000 has been received, so far this year,\non pledges, and some $3,000 additional has been pledged but not collected.\nThe station normally has an income, in addition to such contributions, of\napproximately $10,000, made up of $5,000 from rentals, $2,500 from tuition,\nand $2,500 income from endowment. During the present year the only one of\nthese three figures which has been sensibly cut is the rental figure, which\nwill fall short by approximately $2,000. This is due to the fact that the\nCarnegie Institution has recently remodeled, for dormitory purposes, a large\ndirector's house which they own at the station. This has made it unnecessary\nfor the Institution to rent from the station the dormitory space which they\nhave occupied in the past. It is probable that, for the year 1933, the normal\n$10,000 from the three items just described will fall to $7,000 or $7,500.\nThe final operating budget for 1932 is approximately $48,000. The\nsummer work has not been interfered with, except in the minor way mentioned\nin the first paragraph, and the program under Dr. Fricke in biophysics has not\nbeen cut. In fact, without increasing his budget, his staff has been materially\nimproved. The cuts have largely been in administration of the expense, maintenance, and purchase of new apparatus. One building will be closed this\nwinter. There normally are full-time winter visitors, but there are none\nsuch for this year, and Dr. Harris will carry on his own research in the same\nbuilding with Dr. Fricke.\nThe funds in sight at the present time fail by approximately\n$1,000 to meet the budget for this year.

It has been necessary, however, to pay approximately $8,000 of the\naccumulated eficit with which the station entered the year 1932.\nIt would appear, superficially, that the income during the present\nyear is sufficient to run the station and pay off a considerable amount on\nthe accumulated indebtedness. The point, however, is that the station cannot\nbe satisfactorily maintained on a $48,000 budget.

This assistance took the form of a fellowship granted through the NRC and supported, from 1920 through 1927 by the\nRosenwald appropriations and from 1927 through 1931 by the GEB funds. It\nwas originally at the rate of $2000 a year, but beginning with the 1925-26\nappropriation paid $2500 a year. In 1928 a special appropriation of $1700\nwas made by the GEB for scientific apparatus to be used by J. In\nthat\nyear,\nalso, J. received a grant of $80,000 from the Rosenwald Fund to be used over\na period of five years (until 1933) It was planned that $15,000 a\nyear\nwould be devoted to the support of his research program, and that $5,000\nwould be expended, over the 5-year period, for/equipment.\npersonal research\nJ. has been at Howard since 1907, and has always been convinced\nthat his important task there was to develop the elementary undergraduate\ninstruction to a reasonable level. He has never believed, and does not now\nbelieve, that xxixxgraduate work there is justified. It was originally understood, in connection with the Rosenwald grant of $80,000, that he would\ncontinue to teach elementary science courses as in the past, and that the\nfund would be used in support and development of his own personal research\nprogram. The President of Howard, however, has completely modified this procedure. He has insisted that J. turn his energies toward the development of\nadvanced work, and that the fund also be used for such purposes. He has requested J. to purchase equipment for graduate work and develop graduate work;\nand J. has ceased his undergraduate teaching entirely. He feels that the result has completely justified his belief that Howard is not ready for graduate\nwork. Last year he had seven graduate students and this year he has buttwo\ngraduate students. J. has incurred a certain amount of displeasure from the\nadministration because he has refused to use portions of the grant for purposes\nwhich the administration desired but which he did not consider sound. Approximately half of the $5,000 donated for personal equipment remains unspent,\nand J. refuses to spend it because he recognizes that, under present conditions, it is impossible for him to carry on his research at Howard. J. believes that approximately $11,000 of the $75,000 remains unspent, although\nhe has never been able to obtain any detailed information from the administration about this fund. It was originally intended that J. would have complete\ncontrol of this fund, but actually he has had almost no control. His relations\nwith the rest of the faculty have been difficult, because they have considered\nhim an unwarranted favorite.\nSome time ago the Rosenwald Fund discontinued payments under the\nyearly grant on account of the fact that records showed that a considerable\namount already assigned to Howard remained unspent. At-that same time, Howard\nwas having difficulty in meeting its general salaries, and in the emergency\nplans of the University no provision was made for the salary of J.

J. assumes that the amount for his salary ($7,500 for the\nfirst three years and $10,000 for the last two) has been taken from the\n$15,000 yearly grant from the Rosenwald Fund. The administration at Howard\nhas used some of the remaining portion of this yearly grant to establish\nscholarships. J. states that this is in direct contradiction to the original\npurpose, since Howard asked the Rosenwald Fund for support for these scholarships and it was refused. A considerable proportion of the amount granted\nunder these scholarships is, moreover, immediately repaid to Howard in the\nform of tuition; so that the net result is that a portion of this $15,000 research fund has been used by Howard University for general purposes. These\nscholarships were assigned to J's division, but no importance attaches to\nthis fact, for no general University scholarships were assigned to J's division although all other divisions had such general scholarships.\nJ. reports that he has been able to accomplish no research whatsoever\nat Howard, and that all of his work has been done during the summers at Woods\nHole, at Naples, and at Berlin-Dahlem.

R. Schramm (U. Penn.)\nWW visits editorial offices of Biological Abstracts. Meets all\nmembers of the group, and sees in some detail the way in which their work\nproceeds.\nAbout 35,000 abstracts per year are now being produced, and approximately 30,000 per year are being printed. The ones now being produced\nbut not printed are usually very short, so that a small increase in printing\nwould include them. Only recently has the editorial rate exceeded the printing rate, and the total accumulation of unprinted abstracts is only about\n2500.\nAt the outset, abstracts on articles in important journals appeared about 17 months after original publication. This lag has now been\nreduced to 10 months and the present rate of improvement will further reduce\nthis figure within one year to 7 or 8 months. During the last 9 months a\nscheme has been developed for producing author abstracts in cooperation with\nthe editors of journals. These abstracts are written with the original\narticles, and under this system the abstracts can appear three months after\noriginal publication. This cooperative author abstract scheme has been put\ninto effect with 25 of the strong English journals, with the Dept. of Agriculture, and with the Bureau of Fisheries. Less than 4% of the authors failed\nto respond, and the directions to authors are so clear that, so far, only\nthree abstracts have proved definitely unsatisfactory out of many hundred which\nhave been received. This scheme is just being extended to certain strong\nforeign-language journals.\nIn recognition of the position and importance of Biological Abstracts,\nabout 1600 serials are now contributed without pay and without exchange to the\neditorial offices. Approximately 1800 books per year are reviewed, these constituting approximately 80% of the books appearing within the fields covered.\nThe editorial office has extensive files, according to special\ninterests and language ability, of men who are willing to furnish abstracts.\nFrom 15,000 to 20,000 abstracts a year are obtained without pay from this\n\"special assignment\" group. From 8,000 to 10,000 abstracts are obtained by\nsending directly to the authors after publication has occurred, a similar\nspecial request for abstract. The third largest group is formed by the\nabstracts prepared by the editorial staff. These are considerable in number,\nbut are usually short and refer to the comparatively unimportant occasional\npapers not appearing in principal journals. The fourth largest group is\nobtained from special abstract editors who accept complete responsibility\nfor certain journals. The fifth largest, and smallest, group, is formed by the\nauthor abstracts obtained under the cooperative scheme mentioned above. It\nis presumed that the fifth group will gradually absorb the second group.\n"}, {"id": "Warren Weaver_Diary_1932-1933_62", "page_idx": 62, "text": "Dr. J.R.Schramm (Cont'd)\nIn five or six special instances it has been found necessary to pay\nsmall honoraria in order to obtain abstracts. An outstanding instance is the\nComptes-Rendus de Socie tie de Biologie, in which appeared some 3,000 short papers\na year. About $150 a year is now spent for honoraria.\nThose responsible for Biological Abstracts are convinced that they\nare not spending too much money or effort in trying to do too good a job.\nIt was agreed when Biological Abstracts was first planned that the various\nfields were then being covered in an unsatisfactory way, and that one principal purpose of Biological Abstracts was to furnish reasonably complete coverage.\nUnless the job is to be done well, there is little or no justification for\nBiological Abstracts. The completeness of their coverage has been dictated\nby the subscribers and there are, at present, only two serious criticisms\nof the Journal: the slowness of the indexing and the lack of completeness.\nS. points out that the field now being covered is very widespread, and that\nsome of the most effective and important work they are doing lies at or near\nthe limits of the field. Since the area is so large, moreover, a small increase in radius corresponds to a large increase in area. (This argument of\nS's can clearly be used against him as for him, for it would indicate that\nthe number of abstracts could be cut down quite considerably without reducing\nby much the radius of the field covered.)\nThe possibility of a sectional abstracting service is discussed\nat length. A fundamental and important objection is the loss in synthetic\ninfluence which would result. The importance of the synthetic influence of\nBiological Abstracts has been much emphasized and widely appreciated. The\npossible arguments for a sectional service would be economy and increase in\nthe subscription list. The cost of specialized abstracting in the biological\nfields has proved itself to be very high, and even when the various specialized\nservices are furnished by one central organization, as in the case of the\nWistar Institute, no economy has resulted. S. calls attention to the difficulty in forming useful groupings of the 100 sections with which Biological\nAbstracts now operates. So much modern research cuts across old lines. A\ncancer man, for example, is interested in genetics, histology, cytology,\nmorphology, etc. S. obviously believes that a sectional service would be\nvery unfortunate, but he is entirely willing to investigate further the possibilities of economy under such a service. He promises to study this question.\nThe original estimate of the group which planned Biological Abstracts\nwas that 40,000 abstracts could be edited, per year, on non-honorarium basis\nfor $75,000. Apparently some early misunderstanding arose as to the financial\nimplications of this project due to the fact that Vernon Kellogg, in his\noriginal presentation of the matter to the RF, did not make direct use of the\nreport of the committee. S. and McClung state that it was an entire surprise\nto them when they learned that Kellogg had presented the request without consulting them or their findings.

Bearden (Assoc.Prof. Physics)\nBefore the guests arrive A. discusses his ideas concerning professorial appointments. He desires a small permanent staff of full professors and a larger, rapidly changing group of junior appointments. The junior\nappointees will understand that under no conditions will they be promoted\nto full professorships at Hopkins, and that their experience at Hopkins will\nbe limited to a few years. During this period they must be sufficiently active\nscientifically to stimulate calls from elsewhere. After a junior appointee\nhas spent a few years elsewhere he is eligible for consideration to the permanent staff. The permanent staff is not to be increased in number, and appointments will be made only to fill vacancies.\nA. does not recognize the distinction between a good teacher and\na good research man; but he does recognize as valid a distinction between a\nman whose primary service is to his own institution and a man whose primary\nservice is to a much wider community. The first group includes distinguished\nteachers, research men, administrators, and takes general account of the\ngeneral contribution which a staff member may make to the intellectual, social\nand artistic life of the community.

This formidable machine produces solutions, correct to less than one\npart in 1,000, of ordinary non-linear differential equations of the fourth, or\neven higher, order, taking account of complicated boundary conditions, including conditions in infinity, and furnishing normalized solutions when required.\nThe machine will carry out calculations in less than ten minutes which would\nrequire days for a staff of computers.

K. is young,\nattractive, modest and very keen. He points out that there are two main\nuses for accurate data on heats of reactions. First, they are necessary as\nan experimental check to theoretical calculations of structure. Secondly,\ncomplete thermodynamic data for treatment of chemical equilibria and reaction\nrates consist of: (1) heats of reactions, (2) specific heats, (3) theoretical\nknowledge of vibrational and rotational behavior.\nSpecific heats of organic compounds are being measured by Parks\nat California and Andrews at Johns Hopkins, the latter correlating these with\nRaman frequencies. In determining heats of reactions by the heat of combustion\nmethod, the total heat measured is of the order of one million calories, and\nthe measurement is liable to an error of from one to two thousand calories.\nThe mutual bonding energies are themselves of this same order of magnitude\n(one thousand to two thousand calories) so that the heat of combustion\nmethod\nis not effective. In the computation of moments of polar substitution compounds,\nenergies of approximately ten thousand calories are in question, so that here\nalso an error of two thousand calories is very sorious.
