At one stage in the purification process\nthey must handle from 100 to 125 liters of material, each run requiring\none hour in their centrifuge which is only of 2-1/2 liters' capacity.\nWarburg, by way of contrast, has three centrifuges of 25 liters' capacity.\nIt is not just a question of spending time, although that is serious enough,\nbut there is the added difficulty that most of these yeast extracts and enzyme preparations are unstable and gradually change their character, so that\nit is essential that certain steps be carried out with reasonable rapidity.\nH. feels that he would like to buy a 13-liter centrifuge, which would cost\nhim about $3,000.

One studies some 20 species in the same genera to see\nwhether he can find some other species which contains, for example, 1, but\nnot 2 and 3; another which contains 2 and 3, but not 1; etc. These studies\nare of very considerable genetic significance, and especially of phytogenetic\nsignificance. I. is working with 11 species of colomba, 8 of streptopalia,\nand from 12 to 20 other species. The present evidence is that there are\nspecies characteristics which are unique and defining. He is also interested\nin determining whether the genetic differences between species are of the same\norder as the genetic differences between individuals, or whether they are\ndefinitely of a higher order. He believes that the second answer is correct.\nThey are seeking to determine how early in the development of the embryo\nthe blood possesses the serological characteristics on which their test depends. In the blood of chick embryos there is evidence that the serological\ncharacteristics exist as early as there is enough blood to test.

Now that a considerable number of vitamins are available as pure products, it becomes a\nmatter of great interest to carry out carefully controlled experiments to\nseek to determine what the actual effect of the individual vitaminis, how it\nacts, and how the vitamins are inter-related.

He told them, quite\nabruptly and positively, that he would not think of doing so. They then\nasked him if he would be willing to resign. He replied that he had no wish\nor intention to resign and would not do so, adding that they surely had the\ntechniques available for getting rid of him if they wished to do so. It\nwas then arranged that D. would go on leave, and a temporary director be\nnamed in his absence.\nDuring his leave, D. is receiving his full salary, although, of course,\nnone of this money can be taken outside of Germany. His wife and daughter\nremain in Berlin, so that the money is being used for their support, to pay\nhis insurance, taxes, etc. The Army has made a definite contract with the\nK.W.G. concerning the use of the institute. D. has not seen this contract,\nbut he has been told some of its terms. In the past, the institute has been\nreceiving 50,000 marks annually from the K.W.G. and 100, marks annually\nfrom the state, these two sums making up the total annual budget. According\nto the present contract with the Army, the state's contribution is reduced\nto 85,000 marks, the K.W.G.'s contribution is entirely cancelled for the\ntime being, and the Army makes a contribution of 85,000 marks. The Army\nhas made this move because of their hope (which D. considers quite misplaced)\nthat a group of German physicists working feverishly with D.'s excellent\nhigh tension equipment will be able to devise some method of tapping atomic\nor sub-atomic energies in a practical way; or will hit upon some atomic disintegration process which will furnish Germany with a completely irresistible\noffensive weapon. That this is indeed the Army's hope and plan is supposed\nto be a great secret, and D. himself is not supposed to know this. Nor is\n"}, {"id": "Warren Weaver_Diary_1939-1940_174", "page_idx": 174, "text": "Professor Peter Debye, February 6, 1940 (continued).\nanyone supposed to know the German physicists who are entering into this\nscheme, although D. has already told us who these are. D. says that these\nGerman physicists very definitely have their tongues in their cheeks. With\nD. they consider it altogether improbable that they will be able to\naccomplish any of the purposes the Army has in mind; but, in the meantime,\nthey will have a splendid opportunity to carry on some fundamental research\nin nuclear physics. On the whole D. is inclined to consider the situation\na good joke on the German Army. He says that those in authority are so\ncompletely stupid that they will never be able to find out whether the\nGerman physicists are or are not doing what they are supposed to do.\nDiscovering from rather timid preliminary questions that D. is\nsurprisingly willing to discuss any aspect of the situation in Germany, WW\nasks more pointed questions which lead to the following remarks. Bread\nis\nthe only food of which there is really a sufficient supply, although even\nthis will not continue to be true unless the next harvests are good. The\nfat shortage is the most serious, but the meat supply is also very bad.\nIt is D.' judgment that the people of Germany are not getting enough food\nto maintain, for any extended period, reasonable levels of physical\nefficiency and health. In sharp contrast to the usual circumstances in\nolder Germany, there is a great deal of cheating relative to food. D. is\npermitted weekly personal shipments of food from Holland, so that his own\nfamily has not suffered, although all of their purchases within Germany of\nfood, clothing, etc., are subject to the regular rationing.\nThe\nclothes\npermitted by the present regulations are certainly not ample for an extended\nperiod, and are extraordinarily poor in quality. C. comments on the\nshortage of all the hundreds of normal objects which people ordinarily buy,\nfrom time to time, but which they can, if necessary, do without for periods.\nThus he speaks of the fact that many shops in Berlin have attractive displays in their windows, but no goods for sale inside. He tried, for example,\nto buy a piece of luggage. He found that a fashionable shop had ten or\ntwelve pieces all of which were in the window, and that they were not allowed\nto sell any. The transportation system of Germany is subjected to terrific\nstrain at a moment when it is far below proper efficiency. There is no\nnon-military transportation by truck, because of the shortage of fuel. D.\nspeaks of the fact that the great super-highways of Germany are empty except\nfor military traffic. It is his impression that the rail equipment is in\nvery poor shape.\nD. comments that Hitler accomplished, by going to war, a complete\nidentification of himself with Germany. Under peace, an intelligent citizen\ncan perhaps discriminate between Hitler as an individual, his policies and\nprinciples, and the Fatherland. But in time of war this distinction goes\nby the boards. D. says, for example, that he knows any number of fine,\nintelligent Germans who are working to the very limit of their capacity and\n"}, {"id": "Warren Weaver_Diary_1939-1940_175", "page_idx": 175, "text": "Professor Peter Debye, February 6, 1940 (continued).\nenergy (and it is a very high limit) on the specific jobs which have been\nassigned to them. Such persons find a sort of emotional relief in having\na job on which they can work almost to exhaustion. They do not stop to\nquestion, or feel that it is possible to question,any matter of broad policy\nor general direction. What they do now, in time of war, they do not do\nfor Hitler but for Germany. It is neither possible nor proper to worry\nabout general policies; one only has to do his own individual job to the\nvery limit of his ability.\nThe German people are profoundly disturbed by the Soviet pact,\nbut they are inclined to believe, or at least to hope, that it is one of the\nshrewdest things that Hitler has ever done. This does not spring from any\nsudden new enthusiasm for communism. Exactly on the contrary, they are inclined to think the pact shrewd because it may offer them a better degree of\nprotection from communism than they had before. At the same time, and as\na wholly paradoxical element, the Germans are beginning to realize that\nthere is, after all, not so much difference between their political philosophy\nand that of the communists. Even on such a contrast as private vs. state\nownership of property, the Germans are probably beginning to see that the\ndistinction is a somewhat artificial one when the state is in a position\nto commandeer all private resources at any time and place and for any unexplained reasons which may be judged to justify the state.\nIn spite of these comments, it remains true that there are many\nintelligent Germans who are profoundly disturbed by what is happening.\nAlthough the Reichstag has been reduced to the practical position of a\nprofessional claque for Hitler's speeches, nevertheless it is astounding that\nthe President of the Reichstag, a banker, recently remarked to D. that any\npeace that Germany could get to-day would be preferable to any peace that\ncould conceivably be open to her in the future.\nD. himself believes that certain elements of conservatism among\nArmy officials, bankers, and business men have restrained Hitler, to date,\nfrom beginning total war. He is convinced that Hitler would prefer total\nwar, and that this indeed is the only possible and logical next step from\nHitler's own point of view. D. considers it most probable that the German\nArmy will strike through Holland and Belgium as before, in the hope of\nestablishing bases there for raids upon England and France.\nWW again assures D. that he must consider himself a completely\nfree agent in subsequent decisions concerning his own relationship to the\nPlanck Institute. D.'s son will be with him at Cornell. He left with his wife\nand daughter in Berlin detailed instructions as to just what they should do\nin case of different emergencies or eventualities.\n"}, {"id": "Warren Weaver_Diary_1939-1940_176", "page_idx": 176, "text": "AEB\nTuesday, February 6, 1940.\nDr. Franz Weidenreich.\nThinking it altogether unlikely that PUMC will release any funds\nfor von Koenigswald, W. raises the question as to whether the RF could\npossibly contribute $500 this year for that specific purpose.

If the RF\ntrustees would be willing to authorize as much as $1,000,000, or even $750,000,\nWW would see some advantage in obtaining this preliminary authorization in\nApril, so that the California authorities would have some definite\nassurance from the RF to use as a leverage in obtaining other funds.\nSuch\nan authorization would, of course, be made contingent upon California's\nraising enough in addition to make the project possible.\nRBF promises to think about these questions.

A felt strip around the glass screen would\nmake the box essentially dust-proof, and, in any event, it would\nbe very easy to reach inside and wipe the mirror off once every\nsix months.\nThe one essential point seems to WW to be the amount of\nmagnification. This depends, of course, on the use to which the\nmachine is to be put. If the Wriston machine were redesigned\nfor somewhat greater magnification, the proper procedure would\nobviously be to move the mirror back somewhat, since its displacement by one inch lengthens the optical path by two inches.

WW indicates that\nassumption of the heavy annual budget seems to be all that the University of\nCalifornia can itself reasonably undertake from internal resources. There\nis\na reasonable probability that they could collect approximately $250,000 from\nother foundations (perhaps the Research Corporation, the Macy, the Markle,\netc.) The RF is accordingly faced with the following situation. If we\ngranted $1,500,000, we could take great pride in being the contributor of\nall of the capital costs for this great instrument and this inspiring\nscientific development. If we granted $1,250,000, it is probable that\nCalifornia could collect something further (probably not a full quarter of\na million, because the urgency of the case for additional contributions\nwould be somewhat impaired) and something close to the full program could\nbe carried out. If we contributed $1,000,000, I think it is reasonable\nto hope that California could obtain such additional funds as would enable\nthe 184\" cyclotron to be built, but with certain desirable features left\nout, possibly to be added later if funds were available and the circumstances\ndemanded. If the RF contributed $750,000, I would hope that, by great effort, California could raise $300,000 additional. With the total thus\nproduced, they could still construct a 184\" cyclotron in what might be called\n\"skeleton\" form. That is, the development would be shaved at every point,\nthe building would be cut down to the cheapest possible factory type construction, certain desirable features would have to be eliminated, and certain\nexpenditures would have to be postponed. Thus the original power installation\nwould not be full size, although this could be expanded later, if necessary.\nSimilarly, water tanks for protection from the neutron radiation would have\nto be eliminated originally and would almost surely have to be built later,\nif the project is a success.\nWW tells W. that it seemed important to us to explain the detailed\nsituation to the technically trained members of our board, and to obtain\nfrom them some indication of how far they thought the RF would be justified\nin going in supporting such a project.\nW. begins by explaining, with some feeling, his lack of enthusiasm\nfor the relation of the Trustees to projects and decisions.

It is widely known that the endowment of\nthe University of Rochester stands very high on the national list. D. says\nthat of the $58,000,000 endowment of Rochester, some ten to twelve millions\nare specifically assigned to the Medical School and nearly as much specifically\nassigned to the Music School.

It is D. is point, of course, that it is not\nfair to talk about a total endowment unless one inquires into the obligations of the institution, and it is hardly fair to criticise these obligations unless one understands the historical origin of some of these obligations and the corresponding fact that the university may be legally obligated\nto spend certain sums of money in certain ways. Granting all of these points,\nWW believes it remains true that Rochester spends annually on the Music School\nat least $150,000 of income of its general endowment; and that it spends\napproximately this sum in support of the general community activities in the\nfield of music. D. remarks, somewhat naively, that President Valentine attempted to reduce the University's contributions for municipal music, \"but\nthat there was a strong protest from the citizens of Rochester.' He says\nthat this activity is, historically, an important part of the University,\nand that it brings a great deal of good will to the institution. (This good\nwill, however, does not seem to take the form of contributions to the budget\nof the Medical School!) WW tells D. a parable. A certain family appeals\nfor contributions to buy shoes for the children. It is reasonably argued\nthat the children can not go to school without shoes, and that these form\na basic necessity for the reasonable life of the family. Upon investigation\nit turns out that this same family always has chicken salad for supper.\nIn fact, it is an old custom that the family have great bowls of chicken\nsalad, and friends and neighbors have formed the habit of dropping in every\nevening to eat some of the chicken salad.

MM feels that this situation\nis\ndeveloping along wholly satisfactory lines. It is interesting and\nsignificant that, when speaking of some isolated research institute, B.\nmentioned that this isolation was one of the great handicaps of the C.I.W.'s\nactivity at Cold Spring Harbor, adding that the characteristic and important\nopportunities for the C.I.W. are found when they work in the closest\nassociation with some strong university. This position is in surprising\ncontrast with the attitude which B. originally took, a couple of years ago,\nwhen he appeared to think that the members of the Mt. Wilson staff would\nlose all of their morale and their institutional loyalty provided they\nestablished any kind of connection with C.I.T. B. agreed with MM that they\nnow saw the problem in so nearly the same terms that \"less than one\nsentence stood between them, and they could write out the partial sentence\nin a way which would be satisfactory to both if they could keep Rob Millikan\nout of the room while they wrote it.' In an informal discussion with\nKeppel, he apparently seemed entirely cordial toward the idea that the\nC.I.W. finance the actual operation of the instrument, mentioning that\nthere would be difficulty in allocating $3,000,000 of endowment at one\ninstant, but that such difficulties could always be gotten around through\ntemporary maintenance grants coupled with a schedule of progressive endowment. Unless MM is altogether too optimistic about this picture, it would\nseem that the problem of staffing and operating the telescope is on its way\nto a satisfactory solution. B. did say to MM that it was hard for him to\navoid the feeling that, when the time came, the Rockefeller crowd would wish\nto make some sort of a contribution toward operation. MM offered to make\nB. a bet on this point, saying that it was his definite and fixed opinion\nthat the RF had fully met its obligation and that it was altogether unlikely that it would make any further contribution. B. did not take up\nthe bet! WWB AMJ\nMM reports considerable uneasiness and some dissatisfaction in\nconnection with the momentary state of NRC fellowship procedure. When the\nNRC Fellowship Board last year made considerable changes in their regulations\n(these changes having, as a practical matter, been put through by MM and\nIsaiah Bowman) the difficulty was that the situation was not handled very\nskilfully. Thus the divisional chairmen of the NRC were not consulted\nand they got the unfortunate and unnecessary impression that the new\nregulations were being rather hastily stuffed down their throats. They\nobjected particularly to the regulation that applicants be at least one\nyear past their Ph.D. The divisional chairman protested rather strongly\nthat the number and quality of applicants had gone down this year as a result of this regulation.

EB\nMM reports concerning the 200-inch telescope project. After\nthe large mirror had been brought approximately to spherical figure and\nthen placed in a. vertical position for testing, it was found that there was\na certain amount of astigmatism which rotated, when the mirror was rotated\nin a vertical plane about its center; and a certain amount of astigmatism\nwhich did not rotate when the mirror was thus rotated. The former\nastigmatism was, of course, simply the inescapable and expected error in\ngrinding for which they were testing and which is relatively easy to remove. But the latter non-rotating astigmatism could only be due to the\nfact that the mirror actually deformed when it was raised to that vertical\nposition. This wholly unexpected result has turned out to be true.\nAfter a great deal of discussion and experiment, they have come to the conclusion that this unexpected deformation fundamentally results from the\nnon-homogeneous character of the mirror. The very thick, ribbed portion\ndeflects very slightly under gravity when the mirror is turned to the\nvertical position. This second order deflection \"springs\" the relatively\nthin (4-inch) homogeneous slab of glass on the front of the mirror, producing an unexpected first order effect in curvature. Now that they know\nthe source of the difficulty, there is no serious worry that they will not\nbe able to produce a support system which will eliminate this distortion.\nThe right ascension gear is on the mountain at the present time\nand the declination gear will be done late this summer. The drive and\ncontrol mechanism will be completed in the shop early in 1941 so that it\ncan be taken to the mountain, and there will be at least 8 months during which\nthe drive and control can be worked out in detail with a dummy mirror in\nplace. MM estimates that it will take the rest of this year to remove\nthe rotating astigmatism from the 200-inch and to make a 120-inch flat. It\nwill then take one year to parabolize the 200-inch, using the 120-inch flat\nas a test mirror. This schedule involves having the great mirror ready\nto take up on the mountain approximately January 1, 1942; and MM thinks that\nall other units should be thoroughly tested and properly operating by that\ntime so that the instrument could go into active use early in 1942.

The Chemical Foundation had accumulated\nfunds which resulted from a patent which involved cellulose, and they\nhad been looking for an opportunity to spend this money on research in\nthis area. H. recommended F. to the Chemical Foundation and in\nFebruary, 1936, she began work at the Boyce Thompson Institute, her\ninitial staff consisting of Compton (from Levene) on the organicchemical side, Reeves (from Goebel) on carbohydrates, Sisson (from\nIllinois) on the X-ray side, and F. herself on the microscopic aspects.\nMore than a year ago the Chemical Foundation reported that\nthey did not have funds in hand to continue the support of the work,\nbut the prospect for future funds was apparently good enough to justify\nthe Boyce Thompson Institute's advancing funds temporarily under\nagreement that they would eventually be repaid by the Chemical\nFoundation. In April, 1939, after Garvan's death, and when the\naffairs of the Chemical Foundation were in a somewhat confused state,\nF. says that the Chemical Foundation gave the impression that the\ndifficulty was a temporary one. On April 15, 1940, however, they\nnotified F. and the Boyce Thompson Institute that they still had no\nfunds and that they did not consider it wise to borrow further from the\nBoyce Thompson Institute. Moreover, the Boyce Thompson Institute had\nno further reserve funds which they felt justified in lending for this\npurpose. Thus a rather sudden crisis has arisen concerning the future\nsupport of the work. It seems to WW almost surely true that this\ncrisis has resulted, in considerable part, from Garvan's death and the\nconfusion due to the fact that he made commitments, through the\nChemical Foundation, which were essentially personal commitments but\nwhich were not protected in his will.\nRealizing the uncertainties of the situation, but still\noptimistic about support from the Chemical Foundation, F. reduced her\nstaff last fall by two major and two minor appointments, thus decreasing\nher annual budget by about $10,000. The two men who were dropped last\nfall were engaged in rather general activities (bacteriological disintegration of cellulose; a general study of plant cell membranes) and\nare not viewed by F. as being essential to the central core of her work,\nparticularly since some of these more general aspects have already been\ntaken up by universities, where F.'s work has been much more rapidly\naccepted and adopted than she had previously considered likely.\nDuring the first year the Chemical Foundation furnished\n$46,000 for initial equipment and salaries. During the second year F.'s\nbudget was $38,000, during the third and fourth years $33,000, and during\nthe present year $23,000.\nWW indicates to F. that we will study the situation and give her\nan indication as promptly as possible as to whether or not the RF can be\nof temporary assistance.\nEB\n"}, {"id": "Warren Weaver_Diary_1939-1940_231", "page_idx": 231, "text": "Wednesday, May 29, 1940.\nDr. I.

R. petitioned various influential sources\nto have these individuals transported to Canada, fearing that their\nsituation would be desperate if England were actually invaded. Because\nof the dangers involved, the shortage of ships, and the pressure to\nevacuate children, no move in this direction had been made up to the\nmoment when L. and R. left England. R. knows of only two German refugee\nscientists previously in England who have been sent to Canada, namely,\nHoltfreter and Perutz.

Our conversation, however, is directed towards the general\naspects of the situation. L. and R. make the following points:\n(1) They think it very important that a man be sent from the\nUnited States to circulate as widely as possible in France and determine\nthe actual location and circumstances of French scientists, and which ones\nof these would come to the United States for a period if these visits\ncould be financed and if permission could be obtained from the French\ngovernment. L. and R. are convinced that this mission can only be carried\nout by an American, and probably only by an official representative of the\nRF. They think that such an individual would have an extremely beneficial\ninfluence on the French scientists, if for no other reason than because\nof the fact that he would serve as a link between them, carrying information and friendly encouragement to members of a badly scattered and\nthoroughly dazed group.\nProfessor Laugier mentions the fact that Mme. Mineur, who has\nbeen his secretary for years and who is a very intelligent person, is now in\nVichy and apparently can move back and forth to Paris without difficulty.\nShe has a large amount of information concerning French scientists and\nwould be of indispensable aid to any individual sent on the mission just\ndescribed.\n(2) L. and R.' plan would involve bringing to the United States\na considerable group of scientists. They will not venture to name a\nnumber, but discussion indicates that they are prepared to be hard-boiled\nabout the older men who are now merely illustrious names, and wish to concentrate upon the middle-aged and younger men with really high ability.\nThey are interested in maintaining the spirit and continuity of scientific\nactivity of these men, primarily with the hope that they may presently be\ngiven back to France to assist in reconstruction. But L. and R. also\npoint out the high desirability that the best of these men not be left in\nFrance where they will almost certainly be forced to contribute to the\nGerman war effort. L. and R. further recognize the uncertainties involved\nin the plan to return these men to France to take part in reconstruction;\nfor no one knows when, where, or if reconstruction will occur. They\nconsider it essential that these scientists be accompanied by their\nfamilies, and they feel it very important that action be taken as promptly\nas possible since, in the present state of affairs, these individuals may\nbecome totally discouraged and permanently los\u00e9 interest in scientific\nresearch.\n(3) L. and R. are convinced that such a procedure will be\n"}, {"id": "Warren Weaver_Diary_1939-1940_251", "page_idx": 251, "text": "Professor H.

They think the probability for this approval would be\ngreatly increased if the formal invitations were phrased in terms of a\nrelatively short visit - say six months - and based upon some such formal\nargument as a desire to take special steps to protect aspects of international intellectual cooperation still possible under the present\ndifficult circumstances. L. and R. hope that our Department of State\nwould be willing to approve and sponsor such a scheme, even though they\nrecognize the formally stated arguments and conditions as somewhat\nartificial in character, perhaps on the basis of a confidential understanding that more was involved and understood than meets the eye.\nA\nmajor difficulty is involved in the fact that the P\u00e9tain government would\npresumably be suspicious about issuing exit permits except on the basis of\nshort-term invitations, while our Department of State might refuse to\nfurnish visas for shorter than a two-year period. It is clear that L.\nand\nR. hope that the concessions on this point, will be made by our government.\n(4) L. and R. had planned to visit a considerable number of\nAmerican institutions and to talk with certain carefully selected\nindividuals to determine what quota of French scientists the institutions\nmight accept and under what terms. L. and R. think that it would probably\nbe dangerous to have these possibilities canvassed by, and later arranged\nby, a committee. For they think that the activities of any such committee\nwould inevitably receive publicity and that this publicity would have\npossibly dangerous consequences for the Frenchmen who might come here, as\nwell as for some of those who remained in France.\n(5) L. and R. would like RF advice concerning men and institutions to visit.

They must\nrecognize that the RF has interests in all countries and all fields,\nso that the number which can be dealt with in one field and one\ncountry is necessarily very limited. Many proposals which come to the\nRF have only one missing link - namely, the necessary financing.\nIn\nthis proposal, by contrast, success depends upon a whole sequence of\ninterlocked possibilities, each one of which must now be expressed in\nthe subjunctive mood, and each one of which is highly doubtful.

He left McGill for France because his parents were not able to\nfinance his education, and the tuition at Paris was far below the tuition\nat McGill. R. worked mornings in a shoe shop, in Paris, wrapping\nparcels, for 165 francs a month. 125 francs were required for the\nrent of his room, so that he had 40 francs a month left for food and\nother purposes. For eighteen months he had one meal a day, this consisting of the \"largest piece of bread and the smallest piece of cheese\nthat I could buy.\" His workman's room provided no facilities for\nbathing, and one day a week he had to pay a small fee to take a shower\nbath. On that day he did not eat. R. says that it was years afterward,\nwhen he read Knut Hansen's \"Hunger, \" that he realized that the nightmares\nwhich he had almost constantly during these eighteen months were hunger\nnightmares.\nAt this juncture he found on his table at the Laboratory, a\nletter from the Paris office of the RF containing application blanks for\na fellowship. He refused to fill in these blanks because he feared. that\nhe would be accepting charity. Faure-Fr\u00e9mi\u00e9t tried to convince him that\nthis was not charity; but failed. Dr. Trowbridge then called on R., and\npatiently and kindly explained to him the nature and purpose of the RF,\nemphasizing that they had sought out R. because of the important work\nthat he was doing. R. says that to this day he could not accurately\ndivide the remarks which Trowbridge made to him that day into those which\nwere true and kind, and those which were untrue but very kind. As a\nresult of this conference, R. was persuaded to apply for a fellowship.\nThe eighteen months described above were thus followed by a second period\nof eighteen months during which R. was a fellow of the IEB. With an\nemotional intensity so serious that it was difficult for him to talk, R.\nconcluded, \"So, if you want to know what a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship can mean, just contrast these two eighteen months' periods in my\nlife.

This is the basis of our instructions that no further\nvisits can be authorized or financed by the RF. Questioned concerning the\npossibility of extending the present authority, WW states that this is not\npossible. As an emergency action of a wholly different character, it\nmight be possible to protect Professor Laugier for a short time in case the\nMontreal situation is not clear before the expiration of the present\narrangement.

Rhoads, Memorial Hospital.\nR. lunches with WW ostensibly to give report concerning the\nprogress in the spectroscopic studies of the metabolic abnormalities\npresumably associated with cancer: but actually R. is also anxious to get\nsome light on the relationship of his institution to Rockefeller interests.\nLast summer a woman member of his board asked him for a report, saying that\nthis had been requested by Mr. Debevoise (and presumably because of\nMr. Rockefeller's personal interest). This report was prepared and\ndelivered, and very vague and unofficial rumors have come back to R. that\nMr. Rockefeller is interested. R. is confused and worried about the\nrelationships which may or may not exist between the possible direct\npersonal interest of Mr. Rockefeller, the interest that would flow through\nMr. Packard, and the interest of the GEB or the RF. He does not know just\nwhat to do, and WW is in no position to offer advice.\nAG EB\nMonday, December 30, 1940.\nDr. V. Bush, Carnegie Institution of Washington.\nB. and WW review a series of subjects.\n1) It is agreed that we will request the NRC committee (B. will\nwrite the letter) to give the Carnegie Institution of Washington or\nRockefeller Foundation a specific recommendation concerning the desirable\nlocation and activities of the Drosophila stock center.\nEB\n2) It having been suggested to the Carnegie Institution that it\nmight wish to take ov er the program of the Yale Laboratories of Primate\nBiology, B. has studied the situation and finds that various of his men\n(Corner, Hartman, etc.) are very much interested. Their loss of\nincome,\nand the fact that the only elasticity in their budget results from a term\ngrant from the Carnegie Corporation (which probably will be renewed, but\non which B. does not dare count), makes it impossible for the Carnegie\nInstitution to make substantial financial commitments for this enterprise.\nThey are prepared to furnish general overhead, financial and business\ndirection, and a Director, this perhaps totaling $10,000 annually. But\nthey cannot pledge more than this. This presumably means that the Carnegie\nInstitution cannot take over the project.\nWW informs B. that Blake has\nrecently indicated that the Yale group hopes to continue their sponsorship.\nB. is informed concerning the four alternatives which the RF offered to\nPresident Seymour in 1938, and of Yale's choice to accept the present RF\ngrant (with its implication of stabilization of $25,000 annually) with the\nunderstanding that Yale would raise the additional necessary funds.\nEB\n3) B. says that CIT and CIW now have an entirely satisfactory\nunderstanding concerning their collaboration on the operating program of the\n"}, {"id": "Warren Weaver_Diary_1939-1940_274", "page_idx": 274, "text": "Dr. V.

Although he would not admit\nthis at the present time to anyone else, and certainly not to CIT, B.\nconsiders it altogether probable that CIW will furnish this $30,000\nannually. He is, in fact, quite prepared to do so. Millikan recently\nasked B. to put their understanding in writing. This is being done, but\nB. took this opportunity to urge upon M. his conviction that the construction\nstage of the project cannot be completed within the limits of the present\n$6,000,000 appropriation. B. has studied the last several budgets, and\nis convinced that through delays, etc., some additional funds will be needed.\nMillikan stated that this had been made clear to RBF by Mason. B. was\npractically sure that this was not the case, but simply said to Millikan\nthat, having talked to Mason both before and after his last conversation\nwith RBF, he doubted whether the situation had been made entirely clear.\nMillikan said that he would come to New York presently to see RBF.\n(Incidentally, WW has no present basis for thinking that the appropriation\nwill not prove sufficient. If there is a real difficulty here, it depends\nupon facts which have as yet not been available to ww.)\nEB\n4) Agreeing that Norbert Wiener's proposal for a calculating\nmachine to solve partial differential equations is not a proper defense\nactivity, it is decided to put this question in storage. Sometime after\nthe emergency we may reexamine the proposal to see whether it rates\nassistance, at that time, on a purely scientific basis.\nEB\nTuesday, December 31, 1940.\nDr. F. G.
