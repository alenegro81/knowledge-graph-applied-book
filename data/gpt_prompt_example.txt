WW visits Dept. of Phys. at U. of PA, with Dean Jose Jewell, PhD.
Dr. Peter Stafford (Prof.Phys.) shows his research on magnets he's conducting since August last year.
WW has lunch with Prof. William Meade (Johns Hopkins). William discusses with him the proposed study of organic and anorganic reactions measured by calorimeter. He works on it with his former student, Dr. Andrews. M. described Andrews as a very capable man, but he's not very impressed wih PS.
During the latter part of the lunch, Professor J.W. Allen, lead nuclear physicist, comes in. A. works with radioisotopes produced by a high energy accelerator and mentions also PS and his research.
