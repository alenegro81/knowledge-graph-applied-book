The upper and lower faces\nof the chamber cave in slightly when the vacuum is established and return\nat least partially when the magnetic field goes on. They use two carefully\ngraduated and opposed wedges to correct the position of the chamber walls.\nThey find that 3/1000ths of an inch displacement completely eliminates the\nbeam, and that their present accurate method of shimming the beam is very\ndependable. They are obtaining 2 micro-amperes at million volts and\nan external neutron beam of 40 centimeters in length. By perfecting their\nresonance tuning they hope to increase their current by a factor of 10.\nTheoretically it can be increased by a factor of 40. Their present current\nis admittedly not large, but L.-H. points out that most of the fine work at\nRochester was. done with only 2/10ths of a micro-ampere.\nL.-H. does not have a very encouraging report on his recent visit\nat Copenhagen. The transformer high tension outfit was not operating\nwhen Lauritsen was there. He took off his coat and worked long hours for\nseveral days and finally got the outfit going. This possibly explains in\npart why Bohr is so anxious to have Lauritsen's son come on a fellowship.\nL.-H. says they were somewhat embarrassed in explaining that their cyclotron\nis not operating. He thought the design was unfortunate, particularly inasmuch as it is not possible to remove the chamber so that it can be tested\nfor leaks. Siegbahn at Stockholm is building a cyclotron of quite novel\ndesign. By careful theoretical analysis and removal of all unnecessary\niron, he has reduced the weight of his magnet to 17 tons, the Purdue magnet\nweighing 40 tons and the Bartol magnet 70 tons - all three of these cyclotrons\nbeing\neffectively of the same size. Siegbahn does, however, have to use\napproximately three times the power which Purdue uses. The Purdue cyclotron\nwas built for $8,500, although this estimate includes mechanic's time on the\nchamber but no mechanic's time on the rest of the instrument, nor any stipends\nof physicists. Their design has appealed so strongly to several who have\nseen it that Swann at the Bartol and two English groups have asked L.-H. for\ndetailed blue prints so that they may reproduce his instrument. For detailed remarks concerning the way in which L.-H. was able to cut down expenses,\nsee ww's diary last summer, July 1, 1938. The Cavendish cyclotron cost\nbetween $50,000 and $60,000; but L.-H. says that they simply hired the B.B.C.\nto build their power supply, they actually having a radio power source more\n"}, {"id": "Warren Weaver_Diary_1939-1940_3", "page_idx": 3, "text": "Professor K.

Urey, Columbia University.\nU. reports that they now have 70% concentration of heavy nitrogen\nand that the separation problem for carbon he considers essentially\nsolved. The process, however, unfortunately involves a use of hydrogen\ncyanide, a gas which is extraordinarily dangerous to handle and which is\nnot available in quantities and purities except in Southern California,\nwhere it is used as an insecticide in the citrus orchards. U. may, therefore, have to take a couple of men to Southern California next summer to\nseparate some carbon there. He feels sure that they will have heavy\nsulphur soon. He has a new process for the cheap separation of heavy\nnitrogen from ammonia which he hopes he can set up in some large\ncommercial plant, such as the Du Pont plant. Thus he would merely extract\na negligible amount of heavy nitrogen from very large commercial supplies\nof ammonia, and the cost would be very low indeed.\nU. says that he put his general program before the Columbia\nauthorities some time ago and told them that he needed (in addition to his\nregular permanent research assistant) $7,500 yearly for four assistants\non these separation problems. Columbia agreed to be responsible but asked\nU. if he would make every effort to obtain as much of this money as\npossible from outside sources. U. states all of these facts frankly\nand somewhat naively, apparently not recognizing that under these\ncircumstances a grant from us would in effect constitute a contribution to\nthe general budget of Columbia. He says that he realizes that his\ncolleagues at Columbia have very little money for research and that this\n$7,500 comes, so-to-speak, out of their skins, so that he would like to\nraise what he can externally.\nWW asks him what probability there is of his going to Chicago.\nU. seems greatly surprised that WW knows of this situation. U. says\nthat\nhe would not consider moving unless he could \"move his research with him, \"\nso that he did not consider that this possibility affected his application.\nWW explains that RF grants are not movable.

This was at the time\nwhen B. first came to the United States and he helped B. write all of\nhis first English papers. Then R. was a research assistant for two\nyears at MIT. This fall he became Faculty Instructor in biochemistry\nat Harvard. This is a joint appointment with Radcliffe, and R. is\neffectively in charge of the Radcliffe chemical laboratory, the\nfacilities of which are all available to him for his program of research.\nHe teaches a new course at Harvard in the chemistry of natural products.\nThirteen students are registered and about forty are in attendance.\nThe\nsecond half year he will also teach a general chemistry course, designed\nas a sort of survey for those who do not expect to take further chemistry\nbut who have already had a half year of introductory chemistry at Harvard.\nHe has five graduate students, two of whom are Harvard men and three\nRadcliffe women. In this, his first year of teaching two new courses,\nhe has been rather heavily burdened with teaching, but he expects that\nhis teaching load will be reduced. Radcliffe furnished a fund of\n$1,500 toward the necessary equipment for his work, of which about $1,000\nhas been spent. The Chemistry Department at Harvard has an endowment\nfund for research of about $500,000, from the income of which R. gets his\nnormal share corresponding to his position. At Harvard there is also\na\nDu Pont fund which, among other things, provides $50 for research expenses\nof each graduate student. Miss Comstock hopes to obtain endowment for\nchemical research at Radcliffe, including provision for similar support\nfor each graduate student. In fact the reciprocal agreement between\nRadcliffe and Harvard requires that Radcliffe furnish for its graduate\nstudents as good facilities and resources as are provided by Harvard.\nWW indicates that there would appear to be little hope indeed\nthat the RF could contribute to a general chemistry research endowment at\nRadcliffe or toward the research costs of the graduate students. On the\nother hand, we would be prepared to consider the question of research\nassistants for R.' own program of work. WW indicates that we would not\nwish to undertake this for more than a modest period of one or two years,\nfollowing which we would decide whether circumstances and our resources\njustified our considering it on a longer term basis.

Secretary of a \"Resources Committee\"\nappointed last year by President Conant and charged with responsibility\nfor raising fluid research funds for the physical sciences at Harvard.\nThe other members of the Committee are McLaughlin (geology), Mimnow (radio\nresearch, etc.) and Lamb (chemistry). During the first year of operation\nthis Committee obtained nearly $100,000 for support of current projects.\nOf this $14,000 came from 14 \"Associates\", following Millikan's scheme.\n12 of these have renewed for next year and there is only one definite\nrefusal. An anonymous contributor gave $15,000, mainly for the cyclotron\nproject. From the Milton Fund, with a present annual income of about\n$50,000,physics would expect to get one-fourth, or $12,500. Last year,\nhowever, the Milton Fund gave them about $40,000, drawing upon reserves\nwhich they had been accumulating over the last few years. When WW\nindicated that a few years ago he heard certain rumors that those in\ncharge of the Milton Fund were not able to find, at Harvard, research\nprojects which in their own judgment justified distributing all of the\nfunds which were actually available, S. answered with a little show of feeling which indicated that this point had obviously been raised before by\nother organizations (probably by the American Philosophical Society)\nS.\nsaid that the Committee had indeed not allocated all of the funds for a few\nyears, but that this was primarily because of a conservative desire to\nbuild up a reserve during a period of great financial uncertainty.\nObviously they have turned the heat on the Milton Fund now and influenced\nthem to release part if not all of this reserve, so that this objection\ncannot be raised.\nS. says that they have three kinds of projects under review by\ntheir Committee, - small projects, which involve expenditures up to $1,000\nor $2,000 a year; medium projects, such as the cyclotron project and the\ngalactic bureau in astronomy, and mature projects.

WW is strongly discouraging, but they will\nprobably make some statment to us.\nAEB\nProfessor S. H. Caldwell, MIT.\nWW sees all of the space in the new building assigned to the\ncomputing center. The splendid large, specially designed room which will\nhouse the new Differential Analyzer is inspected. The panels for the\n18 units are in place, all separate parts of these panels having passed\ninspection trials, although the panels as a whole cannot be tested until\nlater. One integrating unit is in place for our inspection. This\none\nunit would have been operating except for the fact that a wholly unexpected difficulty developed at the last moment with a special\nlubricating grease which turned out to be too gummy at the operating\ntemperature. We inspect the operating model of the automatic device for\nsetting initial conditions, for reading final positions, and for changing\nscale. This device is now practically ready for production. The function\nunit is the one part of the machine which is lagging furthest behind, and\nindeed it is becoming clear that it will not be possible to complete all\nof this side of the machine within the specified time, nor within the\navailable funds. This does not mean, however, that a working and workable\ninstrument will not be completed. In fact it is clear that development and\nrefinements of various sorts will and should go on for some time in the\nfuture.\nC. says as the machine is being assembled various problems arise\nwhich could hardly have been solved earlier and in some instances could\nhardly have been anticipated. One such important problem is the following.\nSuppose that the machine is entirely free and that one sets up a given\nproblem on it. The design is such that the machine will automatically\npick out the units which are most effective and most efficient in solving\nthe problem in question. . This problem might require, for example,\napproximately 1/3 of the actual capacity of the machine. Suppose now one\ncomes with a second problem. Again it is true that the machine will\n"}, {"id": "Warren Weaver_Diary_1939-1940_9", "page_idx": 9, "text": "Professor S. H. Caldwell, January 10, 1938, MIT (continued).\nautomatically select those of the available units which are most effectively\nsuited to this second problem. A third problem in turn would make the\nbest choice of the units which are left and available when it comes to the\nmachine. But in the meantime the first problem may have been completed\nand the units of the machine chosen for it thus freed. If the third\nproblem makes the best choice of the units now available, it by no means\nfollows that the best total choice has been made for the second problem and\nfor the third problem, the choices for the second problem having been made\nunder conditions which no longer obtain. It would be possible to take all\nproblems off the machine and start over; but it is important to have all of\nthese procedures systematized in such a way that when one once punches a\ntape for the purpose of setting a given problem on the machine, the machine\nwill always use this one tape so as to give the best possible setting.\nIt would be a considerable waste of time and effort to have to punch\nseveral tapes for one and the same problem. A way has been found\nautomatically to take care of all of these extraordinarily complicated\ndifficulties, but this way quite understandably introduces serious complications in the automatic switches and automatic interconnections between\nthe units.\nThe character of this machine is such that one will never be able\nto say that it is completed in a final and permanent form, but it is\naltogether probable that a state will be reached by the first of June which\nwill justify an announcement that the fundamental construction period is\nclosed. Although C. does not raise this point, it seems altogether\nprobable to WW that some additional funds may be called for, and ww's\nenthusiasm for this altogether extraordinary job is such that he would be\nwarmly sympathetic.\nAEB\nEB\nWednesday, January 11, 1939.\nProfessor G.R.

In this machine the liquid whose\nabsorption spectrum is being investigated (hereinafter called the \"sample\")\nand a comparison liquid (hereinafter called the \"standard\") are contained\nin identical quartz cells. Monochromatic light in the first order\nspectrum from a small grating is caused by an optical wedge, which moves\nback and forth twenty times a second, to pass first through the sample and\nthen through the standard. When this light is passing through the sample,\na rotating sector shutter, located between the main source of light and the\ngrating, is full open. When the light passes through the sample, the\nintensity is gradually increased because of the fact that it passes through\na widening spiral logarithmic slit.

Itwould\ncost approximately $1,000 to install a suitable microfilm camera at Brown.\nIt would be necessary that all abstracters have equipment for reading\nmicrofilms. The Argus reading machine could be supplied to Mathematics\nDepartments (or to individual abstracters) at a cost of $55 to $60, or\nperhaps even a little less. This estimate is based on ww's guess that\napproximately forty such reading machines would have to be furnished.\nPerhaps the Departments or the individual abstracters would be willing\nthemselves to make some contribution toward this cost. The photographing of articles would be done in the Brown Library and D. suggests that\nit would probably be economical to mail the films to some commercial\nprocessing company for development and distribution. The Record Registry\nCorporation of Indianapolis would probably process the film and mail it to\nthe abstracters at a total cost of approximately .01 a page. They could\nmail film to abstracters on the same day it is received from Brown.\nBookkeeping details would be simplified by the fact that when the articles\nwere photographed at Brown one would simply place above the title of each\narticle a strip of paper saying, \"Mail to Professor So and So\". This\ndirection would be photographed with the article itself, so that there is\npractically no chance of later confusion.\nD. thinks it would be worth while looking into the possibility\nthat the abstracting journal itself be handled entirely by microfilm.\nHe thinks it would be possible to get the abstracters to send in their\nmaterial in such a form that it would not be necessary to do any retyping\n(and hence no checking) in the editorial office. The negatives could\nbe\nproduced for approximately 01 a page, and the large number of positives\nwhich would actually be sent out to the subscribers of the journal could be\nproduced for about of .01 per page. Such a procedure would, of course,\ninvolve the necessity that all subscribers have access to reading machines.\nThese machines are rapidly becoming available in institutions, and it may\nbe that a scheme could be worked out whereby the journal would furnish the\nmachine at a considerably reduced cost to any person or institution who\nsubscribed for a term of years.\nAEB\nEB\n"}, {"id": "Warren Weaver_Diary_1939-1940_12", "page_idx": 12, "text": "Friday, January 13, 1939.\nGeneral discussion of Cornell biology situation.

In the cellular oxidation process the oxygen never\ndirectly and simply combines with carbon. Rather it is a process of splitting\na hydrogen off two carbon molecules and replacing these, one by another\ncarbon, and the other by an O-H. These two hydrogens are again split off,\nand in this next stage another oxygen added. Nature seems to prefer to proceed by small easy stages, and prefers a slow degradation process. The\nMeyerhof school has concentrated their attention on the material - originally, say, a sugar of some sort - which is the original base substance from\nwhich the H's are split off and the H and 0-H added. Warburg and his\nschool have concentrated on the series of reactions, and the enzymes which\nactivate these reactions, which pass the hydrogens along from compound to\ncompound as in a bucket brigade. Hogness has made a deep study of the\nwhole enzyme situation, and has a complex chart which schematizes the various\nreactions.

D. has three principal\nqueries: 1) why was this negative not reported to them several months\nearlier 2) why did it take four pages to say no 3) why did the letter say\nno?\nNo answer to the first question, really satisfactory to D., can\nbe given. A reason is that no large project can safely be hurried: an\nexcuse is that this division has been extraordinarily busy due to the\nreview committee activities and due to extended sickness on the staff. WW\naccepts full responsibility for the length of time, which he himself does\nnot consider excessive but which he realizes seems long to D.\nAs to the length of the letter, WW frankly states that he has\nbeen handicapped by the fact that Cornell has furnished no statement of\nany sort whatsoever on this whole problem, - no description of what they\nhave, no forecast of what they want, no outline of general plans, no\nassurance of what they themselves are prepared to do, no estimates of cost,\nno scheme for development of staff, no suggested personnel - nothing!\nUnder such circumstances it is automatically assured that any mistakes\nthat are made are ww's mistakes. If the presentation is not effective,\nit is ww's sole fault because the presentation is wholly his. If the\nemphasis is wrong, it is WW's fault, because the choice of emphasis must\nbe his. W/W felt it was imperative to get the situation out of this protective fog, and into the open: and to go more than half-way, WW took the\ninitiative (which he does not think he should have had to do) and stated in\nfull and definite terms his understanding of the situation. This could\nnot be done in a half page. This letter also specifically asked D. to\ncertify, modify, or extend this understanding; and requested that in\nconnection with further negotiations we be given a definite written presentation of the case. WW also considered it more friendly and natural, in\nthis special situation, to give a much more extended and frank discussion\nof the situation than one would usually give.\nD. is inclined to discount ww's claim that he was placed in an\nexposed position by D. is silence; but before the conversation is concluded\nD. frankly admits that he did not propose to make any written statement or\n11\nrequest, just because he did not \"propose to stick his neck out.\"\nOn the third point, D. insisted that the letter did not explain\nthe declination.

WW reminds D. that the RF usually finds it unwise, futile, and\nmutually unsatisfactory to explain decisions. That we had gone so far\nin\ndoing so because of the special circumstances. WW says that relative\nto this request the following questions inevitably posed themselves.\nHad\nthis division made a grant of this character in the present program? The\nanswer is no. Is this division not primarily concerned with the support\nof\nresearch?\nThe answer is yes. Do we not have many opportunities where\nwe need not furnish facilities from the foundation up, but where we are\nasked only for the oil to make a large research machine go? The answer\nis yes. Would this division not prefer to recommend a substantial sum in\nendowment of research in biology at Cornell, this recommendation to be made\nif and when the basic development of physical plant and staff had been\ncarried along to a point of convincing demonstration? The answer is that\nthe division would so prefer. Is there a reasonable prospect that the\ntrustees would approve a recommendation for a general building at Cornell?\nThe answer to this question appears to be a rather definite no.\nIt is to this last answer that D. primarily objects, with the air\nthat now at last we are coming to the nigger in the woodpile. With some\nconsiderable show of feeling he mentions that before he raised the question\nwith WW at all, he questioned RBF as to whether \"the trustees' thinking had\nadvanced to such a point that\" (this is D.'s language) they would consider\na major move of \"institutional development.\" D. obviously considers the\nnegative answer to the last question as a reversal of the impression he received at that first talk.\nThis is a point WW cannot discuss. He does, however, point out\nthat D. himself had warmly and effectively argued for several past years\nthat the natural sciences, in contrast with the social sciences, have so\nimposing a development of general facilities and personnel that one could\nnot justify for them the type of broad and basic support that D. wished for\nthe social sciences.\nThe conference is entirely friendly, but it is clear that D. is\nmore than disappointed, - he is a little bitter and hurt.

If a really\nsatisfactory set-up can be arranged, Page thinks that he could again get\nsome real money from the Long Island crowd. Under these present circumstances, this support is becoming more and more difficult to obtain.\nThroughout this discussion WW is a little surprised at the air of definite\nassurance with which B. speaks of the ways in which he and Page will presumably\ndispose of this matter, he at no point suggesting the desirability that the\nRF be consulted. WW is, in point of fact, entirely content to let him do\nthe worrying.\nB. is not at all clear as to the values in the Drosophila stock\ncenter, having had this situation somewhat confused in his mind by conversations with Dunn concerning the advisability of establishing and maintaining important genetic strains of mice and other mammals. WW points\nout\nthat Little's laboratory is in a position to do a pretty good job on mice,\nthat the Wistar will presumably do a pretty good job on rats, that there is\nnothing that can be done with guinea pigs (since they do not maintain\nfertility when inbred), and that any possible project of this sort with dogs\nshould presumably be worked out in connection with Stockard's show. These\nappear to be facts which B. did not have in mind. After some discussion\nhe says that he does not think the Carnegie Institution should support the\nstock center, but that he is willing to continue the Drosophila Information\nService and to have Demerec continue his supervision of the stock center, if\nwe wish to support it.

The position of the Carnegie Institution toward this project\nis apparently not properly understood unless one realizes that the Carnegie\nInstitution has always, in a fundamental sense, resented the fact that\nHale, while an officer and employee of the Carnegie Institution, worked out\nthe plans for this greater new development with the authorities of CIT and\nobtained support from the IEB. Bush refers to Hale's action, in so doing,\nas definitely \"disloyal.\" B. says that he considers that Merriam was\njustified when he initially refused to have anything to do with the proposal.\nAs is well known to all on the inside, following Merriam's refusal Hale\nappealed to some of the trustees of the Carnegie Institution and so won\ntheir support that they demanded that Merriam reverse his position.\nThe\ncordial assurances of cooperation which stand in the written record were\nthus obtained, and presumably they have never very accurately represented\nthe real feeling of the administration of the Carnegie Institution.\nAs a second fundamental point, B. is irreconcilably convinced that\nthe only way in which any organization or group can work together\nsatisfactorily is through a centralization of authority and control.\nThe\nidea, therefore, that a group of scientists from CIT and a group of\nastronomers from the Mt. Wilson Observatory could work together on Mt. Palomar,\nauthority lying with a joint committee, is one to which B. would presumably\nnever subscribe. This, so far as WW understands the situation, has been the\nidea at CIT. At least it certainly is the idea of MM who, as things now\nstand, is likely to be most influential in shaping CIT policy relative to\nthe telescope.\nHerbert Hoover has been vitally concerned over the telescope\nsituation in Southern California, and prior to B. 's appointment, was the\nactive proponent of a scheme that money be raised in California to take over\nand set ups on an independent basis, Mt. Wilson and Palomar. It was Hoover's\nidea that the Carnegie Institution would turn over Mt. Wilson plus\napproximately $6,000,000, which would represent the capitalization of the\nannual budget. CIT would presumably turn over Mt. Palomar. B. forestalled any active moves in this direction by appointing a sub-committee of\nhis trustees, with Hoover as Chairman, to have special responsibility for\ntheir program in astronomy (he has similar sub-committees for the other\nthree main aspects of their program - Lewis Weed heading the sub-committee\non biological studies and Frank Jewett the sub-committee on geophysics and\nphysics: B. does not mention the Chairman of the sub-committee on historical\nstudies). B. would apparently be content to turn over Mt. Wilson to such\na development, but he is not willing to turn over the $6,000,000 of capital\nto maintain it, and he has presumably brought Hoover around to this point of\nview.

This solution would\ninvolve the appointment of a member of the Mt. Wilson staff as the\nDirector of the Palomar Observatory. The astronomical staff of the\nPalomar Observatory would be Carnegie Institution employees.\nOn\nquestion,\nB. states that the present staff of Mt. Wilson is entirely capable of\nutilizing the full facilities of both observatories. CIT would own\nMt. Palomar and would furnish the funds for its basic maintenance, which\nB. estimates at approximately $30,000 a year. CIT scientists would also\nwork on Mt. Palomar, it being understood that their interests were\nprimarily in physics rather than in astronomy. All publications from\nthe Observatory would give full credit to CIT. An advisory board with\nmembers from both institutions would have the responsibility for planning\nscientific programs and for apportioning facilities. Final authority,\nhowever, would rest with the Director of the Observatory, who would be\na Carnegie Institution man. B. says that with the authority centralized\nin this way there could be no doubt that the recommendations of the joint\nadvisory committee would be followed. It is B.'s conviction, however,\nthat such an advisory and planning committee would lead to confusion,\njealousy, bickering, and serious trouble unless there was superimposed upon\nit one single final authority.

He seems to think that the RF should have prevented CIT from\ndeveloping in this way. As a final conclusion B. says that he definitely\ndoes not think that the Carnegie Institution has any responsibility to\ngive CIT any funds for the operation or maintenance of the Observatory,\nand adds that he feels exactly the same way about the Carnegie Corporation.\nHe is entirely frank in saying that he plans to have as much concern for\ngrants in science made by the Carnegie Corporation as he has for the\nbudget of the Carnegie Institution itself. WW says, \"If there are going\nto be any raids made, you propose to make them yourself\"? And B. says,\n\"Exactly.'

Relative\nto the dangerous notion of truth he suggests that a statement is true in a\nstrict scientific sense if it has been verified within the specific framework of pure science; that it is truer, so-to-speak, if an invention has been\nbased on this statement or discovery; and that it is still truer (in the\nsense of still more drastic verification) if society has discovered that it\ncan live with the invention.\nM. was very considerably impressed by Richards' contribution to\nthe discussion.

First, and giving due\nrecognition to the fact that W. is a difficult person whose scientific\nbehavior is not always what it should be, L. considers it unquestionably\ntrue that W. has been responsible for stimulating a very large amount of\ninterest and activity in the important field of protein structure. He\nfeels sure that W. will continue to act as a stimulant and a catalyst.\nSecondly, L. does not consider that the attacks against w.' views are such\nas to discredit them as yet. As regards the controversy over the\ninterpretation of the Crowfoot X-ray data on insulin, he says that his and\nw.'s calculations certainly show that the X-ray data are consistent with\nw.'s proposed structure. He agrees that the calculation does not definitively\ndemand that particular structure. He says that Bernal's criticisms are\nwholly unfair. In interpreting the X-ray diagrams, approximately 3400\npoints are involved. These fall into 13 types, of which L. and W. took\nexplicit account of approximately 320 of the points which fell in the types\nwhich they say are most important, their calculations actually involving\nin a slightly less explicit sense a total of from 500 to 700 points.\nBut\nL. says that B. accuses them of having used only 13 points out of 3400\npoints. L. has just read the manuscript of a paper by Pauling which\nattacks the Wrinch theory. L. says that Pauling's attack seems to depend\nprincipally upon a calculation which he makes of the energy which is unfavorable to the formation of the cyclol pattern.

In applying the same approximations to another case, L. says that he can \"prove\" in exactly the same way\nthe non-existence of a molecule whose structure is perfectly definitely\nknown to exist. L. is by no means wedded to the theory, and thinks it\nhighly likely that the ultimate theory of protein structure will be somewhat different.

In several\ndifferent fields of science he went to such a point and showed such an\naptitude that his teacher tried to persuade him to remain in that\nparticular branch of science; but he was never particularly interested in\nthe special techniques or experimental procedures of any of these branches\nand found himself satisfied when he had gained a good grasp of the underlying theory of the subject. He early decided to devote his life to the\nphilosophy of science, his conviction being that the proper approach to the\nphilosophy of science lies, on the one hand, through science itself, and,\non the other hand, through the history of science. About 1913 he determined\nto write a comprehensive history of science, and estimated that he could\ncomplete such a work in approximately ten years. He has been at this\never\nsince. Under the auspices of the Carnegie Institution of Washington the\nvolumes up to and through the 13th century have already been published.\nS. has an enormous amount of manuscript material on the history of science\nin the 14th century, and has now resigned himself to the fact that he will\nbe able to get no further, during his lifetime, than the end of the 14th\ncentury. His life and work being seriously interrupted by the war, he reestablished himself in this country and in 1918 was made a research associate\nof the Carnegie institution of Washington at a salary of $3,000. He was\noriginally given quarters in the Carnegie institution building in Washington,\nbut later he himself worked out an arrangement with Harvard University\nwhereby he is given an office and working space in the Harvard Library and\ndirect access to all of the facilities of that Library, in return for which\nhe teaches one course at Harvard without pay. This has proved to be an\nideal arrangement from many points of view, S. saying that the Library\nfacilities are completely satisfactory. His location at Harvard has\nnaturally led many individuals to associate with that University. When\nConant was made President, he offered to give S. an honorary appointment as\nprofessor at Harvard, but Merriam refused to permit S. to accept this, since\nhe felt that it would detract from the credit which he thought was due to\nthe Carnegie institution. In 1924 the History of Science Society was\nfounded, a considerable purpose of this organization being to sponsor and assist\ns.'s activities. Up to that time S. had published \"Isis\" entirely on his\nown responsibility, although he had received a small subsidy from the\nCarnegie Institution. The Society now has approximately 600 members.\nif\nS. would hold down the size of \"Isis\" to 1000 pages a year he could break\neven or a little better, but he receives so much interesting and valuable\nmaterial that his scientific conscience and his personal and unselfish\ndevotion do not permit him to restrict the size, and accordingly \"Isis\" has\nalways operated at a deficit which S. has paid out of his own pocket.\nSo\n"}, {"id": "Warren Weaver_Diary_1939-1940_85", "page_idx": 85, "text": "Boston, Dr. George Sarton, May 24, 1939 (continued).\nlong as this deficit does not exceed $500-$700 a year he is perfectly\ncontent to make the contribution.

This, he explains with a courageous grin, is a little difficult\nfor him. It will be noticed that the Carnegie Institution has been contributing $1,200 in support of \"Isis\". Actually this grant is not made\nexplicitly for the journal, but rather as a contribution toward the\nexpense of publishing S. own researches, which have in fact roccupied\nnearly one-half of the publication to date.\nWhen Bush succeeded Merriam, S. was naturally very much worried\nand concerned as to what attitude the new President might take toward his\nventure.

This vitamin originally appeared on the market at $80 a gram,\nwas sold by the licensed pharmaceutical firm for $15 a gram after they had\nconstructed a suitable plant for its synthesis, and has had its price forced\ndown by the Research Corporation to $2.50 a gram. P. says that the price\nwould unquestionably have been maintained at $15 a gram had it not been for\ntheir control, they taking the position that a deficiency drug of this sort\nshould be made available to the public at the lowest price compatible with\na reasonable return. In this particular case they agreed to give &. R.\nWilliams and his associates 75% of the royalties until the royalties totaled\n$100,000, following which Williams and his associates would receive 25% of\nthe royalties. This point has already been passed, the total sale of the\nchemical to date totaling over $1,500,000.

On such discoveries as the\nstructure and synthesis of Vitamin B1 P. says that, if Williams had not\npatented them, patents would undoubtedly have been taken out by other persons\nor by commercial firms, and the public would have been exploited. The\nResearch Corporation is a non-profit organization, and they distribute\napproximately $100,000 a year in the support of pure research and make further\ngrants which are rather definitely connected with commercial research projects.\nTheir attitude seems to be a very cooperative one.

The case of R. R. Williams\nmentioned above is a wholly exceptional one as regards the amount of compensation paid to the man himself, this arising in considerable part because\nof the fact that Williams was in a commercial position and had carried on the\nVitamin B work as a personal venture.

The physical universe being composed of\nparticles, G. decided to study particles. He wished to have these in\nthe most precisely controlled form, and therefore decided upon electrical\nor electrified particles. Considering that electrostatics was a\nsimpler and a more fundamental study than electrodynamics he concluded that\nhe would use electrostatic techniques whenever possible rather than electrodynamic techniques. Thus by a somewhat remarkable series of simplifications\nand conclusions, he was led step by step to the development of his technique\nfor obtaining high voltage particles. Relative to any high voltage beam,\nhe mentions that one is interested in (1) high energy, (2) homogeneity relative\nto energy, (3) variable control of the energy, (4) rigorous parallelism of\nthe beam, (5) accurate measurability of the energy, (6) variety in the kind\nof particle that can be accelerated, (7) a field free space surrounding the\nbeam, (8) absence of background radiation, (9) intensity of yield, (10)\naccessibility of the beam, and (11) steadiness and dependability of the yield.\nAlthough he speaks with complete modesty and with complete generosity\nrelative to the cyclotron development, he is inclined to think that his type\nof generator promises to offer relative advantage on all of these points\nexcept the first. Relative to the last named point, he mentions that if\nthe frequency of the power circuit in the cyclotron be changed as much as\n1% the yield drops to zero.\nG. is now obtaining 4 milliamperes at 2 1/2 million volts on his\nlarge generator, which has been transferred from the Colonel Green\nEstate and set up in a new building at MIT. At first they were only able\nto get 1% of the power on the belt actually down their tube, but they have\nrecently improved circumstances so that they now have as much as 80 microamperes down the tube. He feels that his generator has a decided advantage\nin the production of artificially radioactive elements when one is interested\nin the heavier elements. For the first third of the atomic table the\ncyclotron undoubtedly is preferable. For the latter two-thirds of the\natomic table he feels that his generator is preferable since it can produce\na greater neutron beam, these particles entering the nuclei of the heavy\natoms quite independently of the magnitude of the potential barrier.\nG. has received $24,300 assistance in all from the Research Corporation in four grants, a current grant being $5,800.

Other features of this same\njaw, however, are such that if they alone were accurately described the\nsame expert would unhesitatingly state that this was a jaw of a primitive\nman.\nWhen W. showed a cast of this jaw, within the last few days, to\nGregory at the American Museum he was wholly amazed and agreed that this\ncomes closer than anything he could have imagined to fulfilling the popular\ndemand for a \"missing link.' Noticing that one of the fractures of this\njaw was recent, K. communicated at once with his assistants and instructed\nthem to search with exceeding care all material that came from that same\nimmediate neighborhood. In 8 days they were rewarded by the discovery of\nthe whole upper part of the skull and by finding two teeth which accurately\nfit into gaps in the jaw bone. W. says that this skull is unquestionably\nthe most primitive which has ever been found. It is remarkably like the\nskull of Sinanthropus, but \"coarser.\" The skull was broken into three or\nfour pieces, and the most remarkable and dramatic thing about it is that\nthe creature which owned this skull had been killed by a stone ax. The\nskull is cleft in front, and the head of the stone ax is perfectly intact\nand still in place. W. has remarkable photographs of this skull with him.\nW. and K. are publishing a joint paper about the upper jaw. It will\nnot\nbe possible for them to publish concerning this skull until K. has returned\nto Java and has been able to examine the site and question the native\nassistants who made the discovery and who prepared the material which was\nsent. This material is of first-rate importance and interest, one of the\nmost amazing features being the fact that so primitive a creature was alive\nat the same time that some other creature had a sufficiently developed\nculture to make and use so good a stone ax. W. is very much concerned\nover the support of K.' work in Java, the close relationship of which with\nthe program at Peiping has now been demonstrated. K. has been receiving\nsupport from the Carnegie Institution. He had been promised by Merriam\nsome small additional funds to enable him to spend this time at Peiping.\nThis arrangement was confirmed by Bush, but Bush also warned that the\nsupport might be reduced next year. W. wonders if it would be possible for\nthem to allocate a modest amount from the budget for Cenozoic research at\nPeiping to aid K. next year, if necessary. He feels that this work is now\nso closely related to their own that minor support for it could with complete\nscientific propriety be included within their own budget, particularly since\npresent circumstances make it impossible for them to proceed with their own\nexpenditures in accordance with the original plans. There is, however,\nthe\ntechnical difficulty that K.'s work will be primarily in Java rather than in\nPeiping and that Java would have to be ruled as being in \"Asia\", since the\nappropriation carried that geographic limitation.\nEB\n"}, {"id": "Warren Weaver_Diary_1939-1940_95", "page_idx": 95, "text": "Thursday, June 8, 1939.\nDr. Edgar Zilsel.\nThe Duggan committee has agreed to give Zilsel $900 next year\nprovided it will be matched by some other organization.

If\ns.'s theory is sound, it will be possible to synthesize other similar\ndrugs which will be effective in cases where sulfanilamide is not\neffective, it being S.'s idea that the failure of sulfanilamide in these\ninstances is due to the lack of sufficient oxygen supply in the infected\ntissue.

There is every reason to think that much of this material would\neventually be self-supporting, but the sale is of such a character that\ncommercial printing firms will not accept it without some sort of subsidy\nor guarantee. E. quotes the very successful record of the revolving fund\nfor physical books and the corresponding mathematical revolving fund as\nproof of the fact that these funds really do revolve. In both of these\ninstances, a considerable number of important works have been published,\nand each of the funds is larger than it was originally.\nWW indicates no possibility of consideration this year, and the\nfurther impossibility of forecasts at this time.

They apparently\nhave no commercial interest in the machine itself, doubting whether they\nwould.d ever be asked to build another. They do, however, have first right\nto all of the individual devices and inventions which may be developed in\nconnection with the development of the machine. Some of these have been\npatented already.\nThis machine is primarily an ordinary computing device for carrying out the basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and\ndivision. Its special character derives from the fact that it can handle\n24 significant figures, that it carries out all of the operations with very\ngreat rapidity and with absolute accuracy, and that it can be directed by\nmeans of a punched tape or punched cards to carry out a long series of\noperations of different sorts. Two 24 digit numbers can be multiplied\ntogether and the first 24 digits of the result obtained in a little less\nthan 7 seconds. It can carry out the operation of computing to 23\nsignificant figures the logarithm of a given 24 digit number in 68 seconds.\nIt can compute to 23 significant figures the sine or cosine of an angle in\n75-78\nseconds.\nSince this machine works with discrete digits its accuracy\nis absolute, to the number of integers which it can handle, except for errors\nof two possible sorts, those due to slip of a wheel and those due to actual\nbreakage of a part. The second type of error is negligibly rare in\noccurrence and can always be recognized. To detect the first type of\nerror they would prepare a standard type tape which leads the machine to\ncarry out an operation which involves the use of every unit and process it\ncontains. This operation leads, as a final result, to a single 24 digit\nnumber. If every digit of this number is correct, one can safely assume\nthat the machine is in proper operating condition, and can, therefore,\nreasonably assume that no wheel or other part has slipped in the interval\nsince the last similar check. They would propose to make such a check run\nevery morning, this check run certifying the results of the previous day.\nIt will require approximately 12 hours each morning to interrupt the\nmachine, take off the data which are on it, carry out the check run, oil and\notherwise service the machine, reintroduce the data taken off, and start the\nmachine on its new day's run.\nWW asks A. what advantages this type of computing device has over\nthe MIT Differential Analyzer. A. suggests five points: 1) this machine\nis capable of very much greater accuracy; 2) this machine prints all of\nits results, \"SO that tables of functions computed on it could be reproduced\nby photographic means without the possibility of any error; 3) for certain\ntypes of work this machine will be much more rapid, although it will\nadmittedly not be as rapid for other types; 4) with this machine there is\n"}, {"id": "Warren Weaver_Diary_1939-1940_114", "page_idx": 114, "text": "Dr. Howard Aiken, October 5, 1939 (continued).\na single standard technique for entering a problem on the machine by use\nof a punched tape; 5) this machine is one of very much more general nature,\nand can be used for many types of calculation for which the Differential\nAnalyzer is not suitable. (WW will comment on all of these points in a\nletter which he will send to A. soon.)\nThere is apparently no problem in connection with the construction\nand testing of this machine, nor does A. raise any question concerning its\noperating program. He is apparently talking to WW in the hope that we\nmight be interested in helping them prepare suitable housing for the machine.\nA floor of a building near the Crufts Laboratory is is available, but they\nfeel that provision should be made for a direct connection with the Crufts\nLaboratory. It is apparently the cost of this architectural remodeling\nwhich\nA. has in mind. WW makes it clear that we are in no position to\ngive active study to the proposal at this time.\nA. is also trying to obtain funds for the construction of a\ndifference engine. He estimates that one with 86 wheels capable of handling\n25 orders of differences could be constructed for approximately $25,000.\nSuch a machine could produce a complete table, second by second, of\ntrigonometric functions to 20 significant figures in approximately 25 orders.\nThe principal scientific problem which A. talks about in connection\nwith his computing device is that of the integration of the equations of\norbital paths in our solar system. To carry out the computation of these\npaths to great accuracy by successive approximations is apparently a\nsignificant task for astronomy and one which they have not been able to face\nbecause of the labor. These computations would probably take from 7 to 8\nyears on A.

R. apparently painted a very\nrosy financial picture to L., reporting that the University has an income\nof from $3,000,000 to $4,000,000 annually from its oil holdings. From\n30\nthis income they have a present endowment of $30,000,000. The principal\ncannot be used, but L. understood the interest to be available for any\npurpose. For about the next five years this interest will annually be\nused to retire certain obligations incurred in connection with previous\nbuildings, but subsequent to that time (when the endowment will have reached\nabout $50,000,000) the income will be free. L. also understands that\nR.\nhas succeeded in interesting various wealthy Texans in the University and\nspeaks of a recent gift or pledge of about $4,000,000 which R. hopes\neventually to increase to some $12,000,000.\nWe talk over at some length L.'s plans for a 100,000,000 to\n200,000,000 volt cyclotron. On this visit East L. has discussed this with\na large number of persons, such as K. T. Compton, Frank Jewett, Alfred\nLoomis, and others, and has received unanimously enthusiastic support for the\nproject. C., for example, when reminded that he might be embarrassed in\ngiving L. any backing because of ambitions of MIT, said that this was a\nunique project which would be essentially without competition, that he considered it the most important and exciting project in physical science now\nknown to him, and that he would be willing to give it his backing as such any\ntime that was desirable. When Rainey was trying to lure L. to Texas, he\nflatly stated that Texas would build L. the new cyclotron if that were a\ncondition of his coming. When L. reported this to Sproul, S. said that the\nUniversity of California could not itself guarantee $759,000 for this project,\nbut that he was nevertheless willing to accept personal responsibility for\none-half of the sum if L. could get the other half elsewhere. WW urges on\nL. the desirability that the organizational plan for such an instrument be\nsuch as to give immediate and complete assurance that, although it might be\nlocated at the University of California, this is an instrument which was\nbeing built for all science. WW also urges that the project is so important\nthat L. should carefully guard against initial presentation of it on too\nsmall a scale. Thus the preliminary memorandum which L. sent to WW, and\nwhich indicates a total of $750,000, takes no account whatsoever of the\noperating program for the instrument. Having in his own mind the example\nof the 200\" telescope, WW urges that the operating program over a period of\nat least 10 to 15 years be explicitly provided for in the scheme from the outset. If this project is to go forward at all, the success of attempts to\nfinance it will not, WW feels confident, be effectively aided by too cautious\nan initial estimate. It is WW's own conviction that the project is much\nmore likely to demand and warrant $1,560,000, of which perhaps $500,000 would\nbe required over a 10 to 15 year period for operation.

Although man, the unit of\nsociety, is a biological organism, Z. takes the somewhat curious view that it\nis very likely unnecessary to know much, if anything, about the unit.\nIndeed,\nhe thinks that information about the unit is likely to lead one astray when\nhe is looking for the statistical laws of the group.

C. also talks at some length with WW concerning\nthe fundamental policies governing the Marine Biological Laboratory at\nWoods Hole, and C.1 unselfish conviction that the old guard has held on\nto the direction too closely and too long: C. states that it is unfortunate that there has been no more effective development of continuing\nleadership; that there should be wider representation on the board of trustees,\nparticularly to include some important business and financial interests; and\nthat the Laboratory should be broadening the base of its financial support,\nnot expecting that the RF would continue to furnish all the funds. The\nhistory of this Laboratory is primarily the history of Lillie; and the\nsuccess to date has depended intimately upon the fact that Lillie is not\nonly a great scientist but is also an able business man and promoter. The\nLaboratory can hardly expect to continue to find these qualities combined in\na single individual, and indeed there is no such individual on the horizon.\nThis particularly influences C. conviction that they should have financial\nand business interests represented on the board of trustees. C. mentions\nJewett and Langmuir as possibilities, but agrees that the first is probably\ntoo busy and that the second may not be quite all that they would wish.\nWW\nalso suggests the possibility that they might interest such statesmanlike\nmen, with broad and important connections, as Owen D.

The increase in activity has apparently stimulated\nProfessor Dougherty, and he is now rather actively interested in the role\nwhich certain sulphur compounds play, particularly in some plant\nphysiological problems.

Pascu recently went back to\nFisher's original work on protein constitution and, influenced by some of the\nsynthetic techniques, he has himself developed in connection with his\nresearches on sugars, got an idea for synthesizing certain polypeptides.\nAccording to P.'s notion, the process of synthesis would involve first the\njoining of three amino acid residues, then six, then twelve, then twenty-four,\netc. This indeed turned out to be the case and he has synthesized compounds\ncontaining twenty-four residues. There is some evidence that he has still more\ncomplicated compounds. There was a possibility that the compound containing\ntwelve residues would turn out to be Dorothy Wrinch's cyclol six. P., who\napparently is quite open-minded about the Wrinch hypotheses, is almost sure\nthat the synthetic compound containing twelve residues constitutes impressive\nevidence for the Fisher type of long-chain structure rather than the Wrinch\ntype. It very soon proved necessary for Taylor and his physical chemists to\ncome to Pascu's aid in studying these synthetic compounds since, from twelve\nresidues up, they are completely insoluble and cannot be studied by organic chemical\nmethods. T. got a grant of $1,500 from the American Philosophical Society\nwhich he supplemented by $1,500 from his own budget, using this to support\ntwo young physical chemists who are helping Pascu. Eyring and company\nare also working on the theoretical aspects of the problem. T. feels that\nthey have a very important lead here, and that they may be able to synthesize\nsubstances of known composition and structure which will get closer and\ncloser to natural proteins.

They would like to get someone of just\nChibnall's interests, hoping that such a program could be carried out in the\nclosest collaboration with the men in T.'s own department.

WW indicates that there is very little probability that we can assist on any\naspect of this program in the near future, but that he wanted to talk the\nsituation over with B. before coming to any decision, particularly since\nit seemed so difficult to find out what this was all really about.\nB.\nsays that A. is actually a very able physical chemist, although it is\ntrue that S. has so many and such scattered interests that it is very\ndifficult to hold him down to any fixed task. A.'s primary job at the\nBureau is to get forward, as rapidly as may be, with a precise scale of\npH values. Thus A. is supposed to seek out certain materials, capable\nof accurate definition and accurate reproduction, whose pH value can\nserve as fixed and defining points in the pH scale. The determination of\nsuch controlling standards is a characteristic activity of the Bureau, and\nit is a matter which is very important from the point of both pure and\napplied science. B. feels that there are some aspects of the problems\nconnected with the physical, chemical, and physiological characteristics of\ncitrus juices which could properly be handled by Dr. Acree. Thus if\nDr. James in his general program wishes precise determinations of pH\nof certain standard citrus preparations, B. would consider this appropriate\nto have done in the Bureau in Acree's section. If J. wishes to have pH\ndeterminations of saliva or stomach juices of individuals under certain\ncontrolled nutritional regimes involving the use or the non-use of citrus\njuices, then B. would think it appropriate that A. have an advisory relation\nwith such a program, setting up their procedures, etc., but the work not\nactually being done in the Bureau. Beyond this point, B. does not think\nit likely that S. should be involved in the program. Relative to A.'s\ngrandiose ideas of accumulating some $20,000 worth of equipment in his\nsection of the Bureau from RF funds, B. considers this inevitable, taking\ninto account A.'s ambitions and interests, but in no sense either appropriate\nor necessary.

This was done, and involved an expansion of their\nfundamental program and an initial assurance of support over a five-year\nperiod. It also involved the addition of technically competent persons,\nsuch as Professor Hugh S. Taylor, to their staff of advisers. Thus\nthe\nTextile Foundation has been concentrating their activities more and more at\nthe Bureau. The five-year program which they have now underwritten (and\nabout one year of which has already passed) will use up a considerable\nportion of their assets. What will happen beyond that time, apparently no\none knows at the moment. All of this information was obtained from\nDr. Briggs rather than from Harris himself.\nHarris has been developing a program in which the resources of\nof physics, physical chemistry, and organic chemistry will be concentrated\non certain basic problems of protein and cellulose research. In his\nphysical-chemical group he now has7Steinhardt and Gleysten, one of Kraus's\nmen.\nThese two are assisted by Mr. Sutney and Mr. Fuggitt.

He is assisted by Mizell. The cellulose and carbohydrate\nwork is under Dr. Roy Wissler, formerly with Hixon at Iowa, and Wolfrom\nat Ohio State. He is assisted by A. R. Martin, who holds a Master's degree.\nThe work on silk fibre is under Mr. Rutherford, who does not hold a degree,\nalthough he has had more than the equivalent training. This whole group\ncalls on the services of Miss McCelland, who carries out many organic\nanalyses. The physics work is under Dr. L. C. Lewis, trained at MIT and\nHamburg, assisted by R. C. Ramsey. This section is the least developed,\nand Harris is not quite sure that Lewis is the man for them. They also\nhave Dr. Hock, trained with Seifriz at Pennsylvania, and with extensive\nexperience in the Oceanographic Laboratory at Woods Hole on general\nmorphological problems. In addition there is a secretary for the group.\nHarris says that during the last year they have published seven papers\nwhich he seriously considers to represent important contributions to the\nfundamental aspects of their general problem, and that they have,\nrepresenting the activity of the same period, approximately the same number\nof papers which are just being completed for publication. He will send to\nus copies of all these papers.\nHarris speaks of Mark, formerly of Vienna, and the great\nenthusiasm of their group to get Mark to work with them. H. knows Mark\npersonally, and feels sure that he would be the strongest possible addition,\nbringing to them an immense knowledge of and experience with all of the\ntechniques which bear upon high molecular substances.

He is much encouraged by the five-year grant for research on infant\nbehavior from Fels. He understands that Mr. Fels is distributing his fortune,\nand Y. feels sure that at the end of this grant they will either have failed to\nproduce a convincing record (in which case F. will give no further support) or they\nwill have succeeded, in which case Fels will give large support, and perhaps on\na permanent basis. Y. is exploring the possibility of a one-year grant of $10,000\nfrom the Carnegie Corporation. This grant would complete their budget for the next\nyear, and would give an unhurried opportunity to explore all questions of possible\nfuture relation between the Primate Laboratory and various Carnegie-supported laboratories. Y. feels that a particularly happy situation exists because of the fact\nthat Corner is so well informed concerning the Primate Laboratory and so sympathetic\nin his interest. The same can be said about Hartman. Y. apparently hopes that some\ncloser interlocking can be worked out, leading to substantial and perhaps permanent\nCarnegie contributions.\nOf the men in charge of the various programs at Orange Park, Y. rates\nDr. Glen Finch as the best.

WW emphasizes that the decision must necessarily lie with PUMC authorities and that we cannot possibly influence this decision. ww's only suggestion is that W. write Houghton, making it clear that H.
